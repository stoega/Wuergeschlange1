# You are given a string "some_header". Use a regex to extract the ID value,
# i.e., the content of the line starting with "# id: " but without the "# id: ".
# In addition, assume that there can be arbitrary many (also 0) space " "
# characters following the colon of "# id:". The ID itself consists of at least
# one of the following characters: A-Z, 0-9.
# Subtask: Assume that the ID consists of arbitrary characters (except a new
# line character), but at least one.

# You are given a list of strings "some_strings". In each string, there are two

# with the following definitions
#     firstname: Optional, must start with a lowercase letter and can have
#                arbitrary many digits and letters afterwards (following letters
#                can be both upper and lower case) if it is specified. If not,

#     lastname:  Must start with a letter, must be at least two characters long
#                and must not contain any other characters than letters (every
#                letter can be both upper and lower case)

#                "." character, and each such sub-department again must only
#                contain lower case letters (at least one). Examples:
#                "mycomp.it" or "mycomp.hr"
#     Every valid e-mail address must end with ".com".
#
# Additional task for an even greater challenge: Every valid e-mail address must
# have either a whitespace character or any of the following characters before
# the address: "(", "[", ">"

Dear madam or sir,

I am writing to this mail here (office@mycomp.com) to let you know
about some organizational shifts (also let @Micheal know). Here are
the mail addresses that need to be handled asap:
  > gabe.new_man@mycomp.com ---> rename to gabe.newman@mycomp.com
  > li_ly.mcNeil@mycomp.hr.com ---> let her know the IT-fix is delayed
  > andi12@mycomp.it.com ---> rename to andi12.chillings@mycomp.it.com!!
  > nancy.f@mycomp.org ---> change to nancy.f@mycomp.com (and maybe ask her if
    nancy.farlain@mycomp.com would also be OK for her)
  >support@mycomp.com (is this already setup? is support@mycomp.IT.com the same?)
Since we have a special HR-department for management-related personnel, can
we setup an e-mail address like tickets@mycomp.hr.man.com or something like
this (at least the x@mycomp.hr.com part is important, I think, you can name
"x" whatever you wish.)

Best regards!
