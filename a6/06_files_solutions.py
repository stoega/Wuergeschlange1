#
# Task 1
#

# Create a File "my_file.txt" and write some text to it. Then, open it again and
# append some text. Finally, open it only to read all the content and print it
# to the console. Use "with" blocks to open the files.

# Your code here #
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as wf:
    wf.write("This will create or overwrite the file!\n")
    print("Writing with print().", file=wf)

with open("my_file.txt", "a") as af:
    af.write("Append to the existing file without overwriting it.\n")

with open("my_file.txt", "r") as rf:
    # Read file at once (entire content will be stored in memory!)
    print(rf.read())


#
# Task 2
#

# Use the "glob" module to print a list of all files ending in ".txt" in the
# current working directory and all subdirectories. Also use the "os" module
# when joining paths.

# Your code here #
print(glob.glob(os.path.join("**", "*.txt"), recursive=True))


#
# Task 3
#

# Implement the below function "search_files" that searches for files (not
# directories) within the "root" directory (possibly filtered according to some
# given file extension) and returns the absolute file names in a list. If
# "recursive" is True, subdirectories must be searched as well. Do not use
# "glob" but implement the search manually (e.g., "os.listdir" or "os.scandir").

# Your code here #

    # Small trick so we can always directly use str.endswith (could also be a
    # default parameter value)

        ext = ""

#
# Task 4
#

# Write a function that can write 2D nested lists/matrices (parameter 1) to a
# CSV file (parameter 2). As delimiter (parameter 3), a comma should be used by
# default. Optionally, matrix column names can be specified (parameter 4, can be
# assumed to be a list of strings), which must then also be written to the CSV
# file as the first row. The character encoding should be UTF-8 by default
# (parameter 5). You do not have to perform any error checking in this task like
# checking if the number of column names matches the number of columns in the
# specified matrix.

#
# Task 5
#

# Write a function that can read CSV files (parameter 1) as produced by task 3
# (see above) and returns the data as a 2D nested list. The list elements can
# stay strings, i.e., no data type conversion is needed. As delimiter (parameter
# 2), a comma should be used by default. A boolean flag should indicate whether
# the file contains column names in the first row, which should be False by
# default (parameter 3). If True, the column names (as list) should be returned
# in addition to the 2D nested list, i.e., a 2-tuple should be returned. The
# character encoding should be UTF-8 by default (parameter 4).
